# Predicting-Influencers-in-Social-Network
Machine Learning Model that predicts the most influencing person among other users of Instagram using different Machine Learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP and Random Forest. Performed Feature Extraction, Normalization, and Cross-Validation and used Ensemble Stacking Model upon the machine learning models and achieved 89% accuracy.
